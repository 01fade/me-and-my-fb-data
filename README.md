# Me And My Facebook Data

## Prepare
- http server (```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```) in root Facebook data folder (e.g. "facebook-[yourname]")
- move this code in root directory, so it's in the same level as the html, photos and videos folders

## Run
- open index.html from build folder
- for map.html add the section paramater (1-4) to see IPs/locations for the different sections (e.g. /build/map.html?section=4)

## Dev Setup
- install packages ```npm install```
- make changes in src folder
- make a build ```npm run build```
